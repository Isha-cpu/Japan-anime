            Though anime is enjoyed and watched globally, its roots find itself in Japan. By definition,
             anime is simply Japanese animation created by computer or hand. Anime is often thought 
             to have originated in the early 20th century. The style of anime most people and familiar 
             with took off in the 1960s with one of Japan's most prominent anime artist, Osamu Tezuka, 
             and is leading the path for other artists to showcase their work domestically and internationally.

        <h4><font face="Courier New" color="grey">In Japan, anime has such a large influence, you can find statues, other landmarks and sites dedicated to the anime culture and their creators.
            For instance, in Odaiba, visitors will be greeted by a monstrous life-size Gundam at the entrance of the building which hosts a small indoor theme park dedicated to the popular anime series.
            Statues of anime characters, let alone giant statues, may be a rare sight in other countries,
            but in Japan, the anime or otaku culture is so normalized that many of these popular characters appear in other aspects of daily life.
            Other examples include anime themed products and packaging, snacks, and advertisements featuring popular characters, 
            things you would not see so commonly outside of Japan. There are entire stores dedicated to these characters, such as the Pokemon MEGA center in Ikebukuro.
            This store is a Pokemon fan's dream come true and sells a selection games and merchandise that would be hard to find in other countries.
            Anime culture is so ingrained in Japanese society that many companies use anime characters in the advertising or 
            even create their own anime characters or mascots to appeal more to the younger Japanese market. 
            There are even anime inspired vocaloid singers, such as the virtual idol Hatsune Miku, which are anime characters idols. 
            Many of these virtual idols have developed a large following and even host their own concerts!</font><h4>

Also included are arcade games like Super Dragon Ball Z, which would eventually be ported to consoles.
                Dragon Ball Z follows the adventures of the adult Goku who, along with his companions, defends the earth against an assortment of villains ranging from intergalactic space fighters and conquerors, unnaturally powerful androids and near indestructible magical creatures. While the original Dragon Ball anime followed Goku through childhood into adulthood, Dragon Ball Z is a continuation of his adulthood life, but at the same time parallels the maturation of his son, Gohan, as well as other characters from Dragon Ball and more. The separation between the series is also significant as the latter series takes on a more dramatic and serious tone. The anime also features characters, situations and back-stories not present in the original manga.
